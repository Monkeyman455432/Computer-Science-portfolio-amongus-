	 Mythology is one of the key aspects of many different cultures across the globe. It consists of tales, myths, and stories about the world around us. The diversity among cultures has resulted in a wide variety of stories ranging from the Japanese to the Incans. I first got into Mythology when Rick Rioridian posted his dirst book, "The Lightning Thief," one of the first books about greek mythology in the Percy Jackson series. Riordan went on to produce other mythology based books like "The Heroes of Olympus," "Magnus Chase," and "The Kane Chronicles." After reading all of his books I went on to discover other authors who had also written about mythology. From here I learned about Incan, Aztec, Hindu, and Korean mythologies. Mythology fascinated me because of the different aspects and stories that were created. The complex processes of honouring the dead in Egypt, to stories of giant serpents who swallowed the sun. The world of mythology has led to some of the weirdest, and some of the most creative literature I have ever read; it inspired me to research and discover the vast and complex tales that we call Mythology.
